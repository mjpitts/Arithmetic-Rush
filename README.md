# Arithmetic-Rush
An original math game made by me targeted towards a younger audience. 
This game is meant to be run a fully extended browser window on a medium screen. 

**To get up and running with this project:**

make sure you have an up to date copy of git and node.js installed.

npm install to initialize. 

npm start to ge the app up and running in a broswer.

**Progress Reports**

(8-30-2021)Added the gameplay timer component to both the addition and multiplication game modes. Balanced the division questions because the answers were too difficult or impossible to write in. Ex: 1/3. both addition and multiplication modes are near complete, I may tweek the UI a little. I project that I will finish development in the next 2ish days.

(8-29-2021)This is my first series of commits to the repo. right now the most upto date page is addition and subtraction. Most of the fundimental gameplay objectives have been implemented. Currently the goal is to clean up the initial countdown timer and to add the gameplay timer to the core gameplay loop. will keep you updated.
